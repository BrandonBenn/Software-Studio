An ArrayList object 'pokedex' was created to store properties of pokemon.
During the input of properties, the PokemonData.type variable was changed to lowercase to make indexing simpler.
A HasMap 'caughtPokemon' was used to record how many of the different types of pokemon was caught.

The problem I encountered was how to iterate data stored in a HashMap.
The stackOverFlow link that was provided wasn't very clear, so I checked other online resources.
They method that I found was using a FOR loop to iterate the keySet from the HashMap to print the data.
